  <h1>Introduction to HTML - Elements</h1>


  <!-- Lesson1 -->
  <p>
    HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a markup language, since it marks up every piece of content on a web page and defines its type.
    It is used to create the skeleton of a website, which needs other programming languages to be adorned (CSS) and to become interactive (JavaScript).
  </p>


  
  <!-- Lesson2 -->
  <h2>Elements</h2>
  <p>
    The smallest building block of the HTML language is called element. <br>
    An element is identified by an opening and an enclosing symbol, called tag. They embrace the content of the element. <br>
    The tag is enclosed in angle brackets, with a specific name that mimics its purpose. <br>
    An element can be containing another element, depending on their compatibility. <br>
  </p>

  <h2>Paragraph</h2>
  <p>There are different types of elements. The mostly used is the paragraph, tagged by "p".</p>

  <h2>Body</h2>
  <p>
    Another important element is "body", which is  where any content that we want to display to the user will be held.
    There can be only one body element, such is if it was main function of a script in cpp or python.

  <!-- Lesson3 -->
  <h2>Headings</h2>
  <p>
    The paragraph of a document is usually anticipated by a title or a subtitle. This elements are called headings.<br>
    You can have different heading levels, tagged as "hn" where n is a natural number regarding the hierarchy. <br>
    The value of n starts from 1 for the main title and increases for the sections, subsections, etc... reaching its maximum at 6
  </p>

  <h2>Line break</h2>
  <p>
    In a paragraph you might want to andare a capo without starting another element of the same type.<br>
    To do so, you need to use a line breaker, that is another element, tagged as "br".<br>
    The just mentioned tag doesn't need to be closed, bcause its a self-closing tag.
  </p>

  <h2>Exercise 3: Delusional thoughts</h2>
  <h3>Loosing my religion</h3>
  <h4>by Nicholas D. Kristof</h4>
  <h5>2003, Oct 4th</h5>
  <p>Oh no, I've said too much.<br>
    I haven't said enough.<br>
    I thought that I heard you laughing.<br>
    I thought that I heard you sing.<br>
    I think I thought I saw you try.
  </p>






  <!-- Lesson4 -->  
  <h2>Text formatting</h2>
  <p>
    While writing a text, you might need to give more importance to some words or sentences more than others.<br>
    To do that, you can change the format of that certain part of text, making it bold, italic, underlined, striked-through with the proper tags "b", "i", "u", "s" respectively. <br>
    Read the following example to understand even better the use of these types of elements.<br>
    <b>Note</b>:  The tags above are good for learning how to style text with basic HTML, but are no longer best practice. Other ways to style text will be covered in the CSS course.
  </p>

  <!-- Lesson5 -->
  <h2>Comments</h2>
  <p>
    You might want to take notes on your programming interface about what you're writing, without showing the result in the effective HTML file.<br>
    This techique is always used by programmers in other programming languages too and is called "commenting". Each note is called "comment".<br>
    Each programming language has a specific grammar to write a comment, in HTML you should use the opening elements "<" followed by "!--" and to close just write "-->".
  </p>
  <!-- This is a comment -->

  <h2>Lists</h2>
  <p>
    It usually happens that you need to write a list of elements. In HTML there are two types of lists.<br>
    One desplays each single item in the exact order you have written them with a dot, it's tagged as "ul" (unordered list).<br>
    The other one gives a natural number to every element, tagging the list as "ol" (ordered list).<br>
    Both these lists are elements for HTML and distinguish each item by the tag "li" (listed item).
  </p>

  <h2>Exercise 5: Barbecue Meatloaf</h2>
  <p>
    Ingredients:
    <ul>
      <li>1 sleeve (about 29) buttery round crackers such as Ritz, crushed to fine crumbs;</li>
      <li>1 cup barbecue sauce, divided;</li>
      <li>2 large eggs;</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt;</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper;</li>
      <li>2 pounds ground beef, 10 to 20% fat;</li>
      <li>1 medium sweet onion, grated on the large holes of a box grater (about 3/4 cup).</li>
    </ul>
    To make the barbecue meatloaf you have to
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350Â°F and line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. In a large bowl, combine the cracker crumbs, 1/2 cup of the barbecue sauce, eggs, salt, and pepper. Stir and set aside for 10 minutes to soften. Once the cracker crumbs are moistened, add the ground beef and grated onion and stir or mix with clean hands to thoroughly combine.</li>
      <li>Put the meatloaf mixture in the middle of the prepared baking sheet and form it into a 9 x 5-inch loaf. Bake the meatloaf for 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>Spread the remaining 1/2 cup of barbecue sauce on top of the partially-baked meatloaf, then continue to bake until the center of the meatloaf reads 160Â°F on an instant-read thermometer, 25 to 35 more minutes.</il>
      <li>Let the meatloaf cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes so it slices more neatly. Use a sharp knife to cut the meatloaf into thick slices and serve.</li>
      <li>Store leftovers in an airtight container for up to 5 days. Reheat slices of meatloaf in the microwave, covered with a paper towel, until heated through.</li>
    </ol>
